                    <p>
                        Back in 2020, I decided to try my hand at programming and tumbled head 
                        first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development. I learnt under the guidance of one of my friends
                        who is a professional software engineer. I learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, 
                        worked on a few basic personal projects for practice. I proceeded to learning React.js and React Native,
                        I found React Native more fun and easier to understand, used it to build a nice looking
                        UI of a rental mobile app that I had intended to be my startup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fast-forward to 2022, I got a job as a hydrogeologist, carrying out groundwater 
                        siting, drilling supervision, casing installation and development, and well testing.I abandoned programming and started learning Data analytics using Python,
                        Excel, Power BI and SQL. This was because of the demand for data analysis skills at my the job.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It's now 2024, I have come back to programming after realising, it is my paasion that I dont want to go to waste.
                        This time I have made a commitment to take it more serious and make it a career as a fullstack web development.
                        To keep this commitment, I paid for Tunga Impact Academy training and I am currently enjoying the learning.
                        I have learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, working on some projects and then I will proceed to 
                        learn Node.js, MySQL and Express.js. I have been working on a restaurant web application, <a href="https://eatup256.netlify.app" target="_blank">EatUp</a> where the customers can see through the menu and order food. I keep adding new features with my learning. <i>I am ready for this.</i>

                                I design websites using HTML and CSS and add interactivity of the site using JavaScript.
                                I create the database using SQL and run it on a server using Node.js. I use Express.js to create the API.

                This example use media queries to transform the sidenav 
                to a top navigation bar when the screen size is 900px or less.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have also added a media query for screens that are 400px or less, 
                which will vertically stack and center the navigation links.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will learn more about media queries and responsive 
                web design later in our CSS Tutorial.
